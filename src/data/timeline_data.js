        details: `In parallel with my studies, I joined Flusk as a Lead Developer. The company aimed at creating a SaaS allowing Bubble.io users to perform automatic penetration testing on their web-app. 
                During my time at Flusk, I've had to handle a great deal of responsibilities including: plugin development, customer relations, Chrome Extensions 
                as well as API and Endpoint integration with Node.js. My greatest achievement was to successfully reverse engineer Bubble's platform itself on my own. 
                This has allowed us to test our clients' Databases privacy rules. Meanwhile, our competitors had multiple engineers, and a greater budget, 
                this launched our Services to the top of the competition. Once the tool published, it brought us The Bubble Developer award, as well as appraisal and recognition from the community.`

        details: `In 2022, I've had the privilege to join the visionary 42 schools network. In short: No teachers here, only a bunch of brilliant and passionate minds\
        thrown together in a big cluster of computers. As we complete our increasingly difficult projects, we learn how to learn, as well as how to teach, instantiating a constant flow of \
        knowledge, freely navigating from one brain to the other. Whereas Academia has always been rigidly gatekeeping knowledge, teaching us not to share our discoveries with our peers, \
        42 aims at being more inclusive and supports group effort for problem-solving.`

        duration: '2 years',
        details: `After realizing IT was the right path for me, I decided to make the challenge a little harder, and went to study abroad. 
                That is how I ended up enrolled in a Computer Sciences Bachelor at Oxford Brookes University. Unfortunately, it was only to be further disappointed in Academia. 
                When arriving at University, I was expecting to meet great minds in a place where knowledge converge, only to understand it was another business, 
                saving the access to Education to the privileged and the lucky. The cursus itself was nowhere near challenging, and after spending two years there, 
                it became obvious to me that I was going to turn into a Software Engineer that doesn't know how to code. That aside, even if I appreciate the great deal of Theoretical knowledge
                I've acquired at University, I will never regret quitting conventional Academia once and for all.`
