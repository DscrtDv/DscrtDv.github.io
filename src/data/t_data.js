        details: 'In parralel with my studies, I joined Flusk as a Lead Developper. The company aimed at creating a SaaS allowing Bubble.io \
        users to perform automatic penetration testing on their web-app. During my time at Flusk, I\'ve had to handle a great deal of responsabilities\
        including: plugin development, customer relations, Chrome Extensions as well as API and Endpoint integration with NodeJS. My greatest achievement was to \
        successfuly reverse engineer Bubble\'s platform itself on my own. This has allowed us to test our clients\' DataBase privacy rules. Meanwhile our competitors\
        had multiple engineers, and a greater budget, this launched our Services to the top the competition. Once the tool published it brought us The Bubble Developper award, \
        as well as appraisal and recognition from the comunity.'

        thrown together in a big cluster of computers. As we complete our increasingly difficult projects, we learn how to learn, as well as how to teach, instantiating a constant flow of \
        knowledge, freely navigating from one brain to the other. Whereas Academia has always been rigidly gatekeeping knowledge, teaching us not to share our discoveries with our peers, \
        42 aims at being more inclusive and supports group effort for problem solving.'

        duration: '2 years',
        details: 'After realizing IT was the right path for me, I decided to make the challenge a little harder, and went to study abroad. That is how I ended up enrolled in a Computer \
        Sciences Bachelor at Oxford Brookes University. Unfortunatly, it was only to be futher disapointed in Academia. When arriving at University, I was expecting to meet great minds \
        in a place where knowledge converge, only to understand it was another buisness, saving the access to Education to the priviliged and the lucky. The cursus itself was \
        nowhere near challenging, and after spending two years there, it became obvious to me that I was going to turn into a Software Engineer that doesn\'t know how to code. \
        That aside, even if I appreciate the great deal of Theoretical knowledge I\'ve aquired at University, I will never regret quitting conventional Academia once \
        and for all.'
